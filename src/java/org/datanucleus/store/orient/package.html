<!--	REVIEW: Orient licenses their software to DataNucleus under their xxx license. 
        This means that since DataNucleus Orient support is classified as a "derivative of Orient" (since it 
        needs it to compile, and uses its API) and since DataNucleus has always been licensed under the 
        Apache 2 license, then DataNucleus Orient support can also be released under the Apache 2 license.
